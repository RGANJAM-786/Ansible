🔹 What is Ansible?

👉 “Ansible is an automation tool that helps us manage servers, deploy applications, and configure systems without doing everything manually. It works by connecting to servers (via SSH) and running instructions written in a simple language called YAML. The best part is – it doesn’t need any special agent installed on servers, just Python and SSH access.”


🔹 Why do we use Ansible?

👉 “Instead of logging into each server one by one to configure or update them, Ansible allows us to write the steps once (in a Playbook) and then run them on hundreds of servers at the same time. This saves time, avoids human error, and ensures consistency.”


🔹 Key Features in simple words:

Agentless – No need to install extra software on servers.

YAML-based Playbooks – Very easy to read/write (like plain English).

Idempotent – If you run the same Playbook multiple times, it won’t break anything. It only applies changes if needed.

Scalable – Works for 1 server or 1000 servers.

# 🔹 How I used Ansible in my project?

Server Setup

👉 “Whenever we got a new server, instead of setting it up manually, I used Ansible Playbooks to automatically install required software like Docker, Kubernetes, and Nginx. This saved a lot of time and ensured all servers had the same setup.”


Application Deployment

👉 “After every new build, we used Ansible to deploy our applications. For example, instead of running commands manually, Ansible would copy the code, build Docker images, and restart services automatically.”


Configuration Management

👉 “We had multiple environments – Dev, Staging, and Prod. I used Ansible to keep configuration files (like database URLs, API keys) consistent and environment-specific. This reduced errors between environments.”


Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

👉 “We treated our server setup as code using Ansible. That means if we needed to rebuild or scale servers, we just ran the Playbook, and Ansible would configure everything the same way every time.
This made our infrastructure repeatable and version-controlled in Git.”


# 🔹 Which tool do I prefer for deployment – Jenkins, ArgoCD, or Ansible?

👉 Jenkins

“I prefer Jenkins when I need a CI/CD pipeline that handles building code, running tests, and then triggering deployments. Jenkins is great for automation from source code to artifact creation.”


👉 ArgoCD

“I prefer ArgoCD when I’m working with Kubernetes and want to follow the GitOps model. With ArgoCD, deployments are completely Git-driven – if I update YAML files in Git, ArgoCD syncs and applies them to the cluster automatically. This is best for modern Kubernetes workloads.”


👉 Ansible

“I prefer Ansible for server configuration and application deployment outside Kubernetes. For example, setting up servers, installing packages, configuring services, or deploying apps on VMs. It’s great for infrastructure automation.”


🔹 My Choice

“In my project, I often used Jenkins + ArgoCD together: Jenkins handled the build and pushed images to Docker registry, and ArgoCD pulled the updated manifests from Git and deployed them to Kubernetes.
If I’m working outside Kubernetes, like deploying on bare-metal servers or VMs, then I use Ansible.”
