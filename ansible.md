🔹 What is Ansible?

👉 “Ansible is an automation tool that helps us manage servers, deploy applications, and configure systems without doing everything manually. It works by connecting to servers (via SSH) and running instructions written in a simple language called YAML. The best part is – it doesn’t need any special agent installed on servers, just Python and SSH access.”


🔹 Why do we use Ansible?

👉 “Instead of logging into each server one by one to configure or update them, Ansible allows us to write the steps once (in a Playbook) and then run them on hundreds of servers at the same time. This saves time, avoids human error, and ensures consistency.”


🔹 Key Features in simple words:

Agentless – No need to install extra software on servers.

YAML-based Playbooks – Very easy to read/write (like plain English).

Idempotent – If you run the same Playbook multiple times, it won’t break anything. It only applies changes if needed.

Scalable – Works for 1 server or 1000 servers.

# 🔹 How I used Ansible in my project?

Server Setup

👉 “Whenever we got a new server, instead of setting it up manually, I used Ansible Playbooks to automatically install required software like Docker, Kubernetes, and Nginx. This saved a lot of time and ensured all servers had the same setup.”


Application Deployment

👉 “After every new build, we used Ansible to deploy our applications. For example, instead of running commands manually, Ansible would copy the code, build Docker images, and restart services automatically.”


Configuration Management

👉 “We had multiple environments – Dev, Staging, and Prod. I used Ansible to keep configuration files (like database URLs, API keys) consistent and environment-specific. This reduced errors between environments.”


Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

👉 “We treated our server setup as code using Ansible. That means if we needed to rebuild or scale servers, we just ran the Playbook, and Ansible would configure everything the same way every time.
This made our infrastructure repeatable and version-controlled in Git.”


# 🔹 Which tool do I prefer for deployment – Jenkins, ArgoCD, or Ansible?

👉 Jenkins

“I prefer Jenkins when I need a CI/CD pipeline that handles building code, running tests, and then triggering deployments. Jenkins is great for automation from source code to artifact creation.”


👉 ArgoCD

“I prefer ArgoCD when I’m working with Kubernetes and want to follow the GitOps model. With ArgoCD, deployments are completely Git-driven – if I update YAML files in Git, ArgoCD syncs and applies them to the cluster automatically. This is best for modern Kubernetes workloads.”


👉 Ansible

“I prefer Ansible for server configuration and application deployment outside Kubernetes. For example, setting up servers, installing packages, configuring services, or deploying apps on VMs. It’s great for infrastructure automation.”


🔹 My Choice

“In my project, I often used Jenkins + ArgoCD together: Jenkins handled the build and pushed images to Docker registry, and ArgoCD pulled the updated manifests from Git and deployed them to Kubernetes.
If I’m working outside Kubernetes, like deploying on bare-metal servers or VMs, then I use Ansible.”

The Ansible architecture consists of users who create playbooks (instructions) that tell Ansible (the automation tool) what to do on different hosts (computers or servers). Ansible uses modules to perform tasks, and it connects to the hosts through connection plugins (like SSH). There are plugins to add extra features, and Ansible can even work with machines in the cloud (private or public). This whole system helps you automate boring or repetitive tasks, making your job easier and faster.


Let's discuss about the each components of Ansible Architecture:

1. Users

The users are system administrators, DevOps engineers, or anyone who needs to automate tasks on servers or cloud resources.
Users interact with Ansible by writing playbooks and managing inventories. They initiate the automation tasks and decide which machines (hosts) need to be configured or managed.

2. Ansible

Ansible is the automation tool at the center of this architecture. It is responsible for executing tasks that automate IT operations like installing software, setting up configurations, or deploying applications.
Ansible doesn't require an agent installed on the remote machines. It uses SSH (or other methods) to communicate directly with the hosts.

3. Host Inventory

This is a list of all the machines that Ansible will manage. It contains the IP addresses or hostnames of the servers, virtual machines, or cloud instances.
When you run an automation task (like a playbook), Ansible knows which machines (hosts) to apply the task to because it checks the host inventory. You can also group hosts into categories (for example, all web servers) to target specific machines.

4. Playbooks

A playbook is a YAML file containing a series of tasks to be executed by Ansible. It defines the actions that Ansible will perform on the hosts defined in the inventory.

5. Core Modules and Custom Modules

Core Modules: These are the default modules that come with Ansible. For example, apt is used to manage packages on Debian-based systems, and service is used to start/stop services.

Custom Modules: Sometimes, Ansible's built-in modules might not be enough. You can create custom modules to meet specific needs. For example, if you have a unique application or environment, you can write your own module to automate its management.

6. Plugins (Email, Logging, Other)
These are additional modules that can extend Ansible’s functionality. Plugins might include email notifications, logging, or others to customize or enhance the automation process.

7. Connection Plugins

Connection plugins handle how Ansible connects to the remote machines (hosts).
The most common connection method is SSH (for Linux machines). This means Ansible will use SSH to remotely execute commands on the hosts.
For Windows, Ansible uses WinRM (Windows Remote Management) as a connection plugin.

8. Private/Public Cloud

This indicates that Ansible can interact with both private and public cloud environments to automate the deployment and management of cloud-based infrastructure.
Private Cloud: Your internal cloud infrastructure (such as OpenStack or VMware).

Public Cloud: Cloud platforms like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud


🔹 Scenario 1:

Q: You already have Jenkins for CI/CD, why did you still use Ansible in your project?

A (Interview-style):

“Jenkins helped us automate builds and deployments, but it doesn’t manage server configurations by itself. For example, installing Docker, configuring Kubernetes nodes, or updating Nginx configs needed a configuration management tool. That’s where Ansible came in.
We used Jenkins + Ansible together – Jenkins triggered pipelines, and Ansible Playbooks handled server provisioning and application deployment. This way, our infra setup and deployments were fully automated.”

🔹 Scenario 2:

Q: What challenges did you face with Ansible and how did you troubleshoot?

A:
“One issue we faced was playbook execution failures due to missing SSH keys or wrong inventory configuration. We fixed it by standardizing SSH key distribution and using Ansible Vault for secrets.
Another challenge was long execution time for large inventories. We optimized it using Ansible parallelism (forks) and by splitting tasks into smaller roles.
So, by troubleshooting logs (-vvv option) and modularizing Playbooks, we made it stable.”

🔹 Scenario 3:

Q: If you have Puppet or Chef in place, why would you still prefer Ansible?

A:
“Puppet and Chef are powerful, but they require agents and a central master server, which adds complexity. In our case, we needed something simple, lightweight, and quick to adopt. Ansible was agentless, easy to learn (YAML), and we could start using it immediately.
For a fast-moving DevOps environment, Ansible gave us quicker results with less overhead.”

🔹 Scenario 4:

Q: How did you manage multiple environments (Dev, Stage, Prod) with Ansible?

A:
“We maintained separate inventory files for each environment and used group_vars to keep environment-specific configs. For example, database credentials and URLs were different in Dev, Stage, and Prod. Ansible made it easy to manage because the same Playbook could run in all environments with different variables.”

🔹 Scenario 5:

Q: Can you give a real example of how Ansible saved your time in the project?

A:
“Yes, one example was Kubernetes node setup. Earlier, we manually installed Docker, Kubeadm, and network plugins on each server, which took hours. With Ansible Playbooks, we automated it – so adding a new node took just minutes. This reduced errors and saved huge effort for the infra team.”

9. Hosts (Host 1, Host 2, Host 3... Host N)

Hosts are the machines (servers, virtual machines, or containers) that Ansible manages.
They can be part of your private or public cloud infrastructure or even physical machines.
You can define a group of hosts (like all web servers or all database servers) and then run tasks on all of them at once.
