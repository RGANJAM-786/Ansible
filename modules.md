âœ… Key takeaway for interviews:

I used debug to print variable values.

Found the root cause was wrong variable path/naming issue.

Fixed it and avoided a production misconfiguration.

Handlers in ansible
====================

IQ] what is the difference between tasks and handlers?

--> Tasks are executed in the order they are defined in the playbook. All tasks will run every time the playbook is executed, unless certain conditions (like when statements) are specified.


--> Handlers are only executed when notified by a task. If a task makes a change (e.g., installing a package or modifying a file) and issues a notification to a handler, the handler will run after all tasks have been processed.

--> handlers are special kind of tasks, It will not executed by default, until other tasks are notify.


--> Handlers will execute at end of the play.
